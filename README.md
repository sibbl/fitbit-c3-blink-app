## How to use

Just install and open the app (still waiting for approval, so Fitbit Gallery link will follow).

## Features

* Screen stays on until the app is closed.
* Colors cycle automatically through all 8 combinations of red, green and blue being on or off.
* The upper pyhsical button lets you change the interval (some love it faster, some slower).
* The lower physical button lets you change the screen brightness (better visibility vs battery life).
* Tap the screen to rotate it by 180 degrees (so that other people know where they are and which time it is).
